How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
       it helps me to see the bug by viewing differencis between two versions.
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
 	easily compare new version and old version so that find errors.
    

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    if I manually create the commits, it would be a very clear and proper commit.
but it has probability to forget to create the commits.
 on the other hand, if I create automatically, there’s a safety not to forget. but it can be too big or too small because I could’t choose prefer commit point.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	Because, the work is related with several files. So if I changed something in one file I would often change other files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used for searching what I want to compare and git diff is used for comparing the files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	because I can get back to the older version to use git checkout

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git for making a big application.
